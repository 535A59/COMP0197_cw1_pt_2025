In multicategory classification, the random guess benchmark is calculated in two ways: if the categories are balanced, the uniform guess accuracy is 1/K (10 per cent when K = 10); if the categories are not balanced, it is the sum of the proportions of the categories. In this problem, because the categories are balanced, so I use the uniform guess, and then want to use the accuracy to test, for CIFAR10random gauss expected accuracy should be 10%
